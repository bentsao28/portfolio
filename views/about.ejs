					<h1 style="font-weight:900;font-size:5vw;">a little about me...</h1>
					<p style="font-size:1.3vw;">My name is Ben, I've been doing marketing stuff for the last 5 years or so, but recently realized that I lacked some skills in order to truly make it out here in Silicon Valley. I'm a Bay Area native, so I wasn't going anywhere. I have always been interested in coding, but never had the time to learn due to work and other commitments. Then my little cousin graduated from college and ended up getting a coding job with a salary already pretty close to mine, so I decided it was time to take action and jump on the bandwagon.</p>
					<p style="font-size:1.3vw;">I heard about coding bootcamps where they specialize in teaching people how to become developers in under 3 months. I applied to a few and ended up choosing Coding Dojo because they did not require any prior programming experience which is great for a novice like me and they would teach three full stacks, whatever that meant. It ended up being a great decision, I learned a bunch of stuff I never thought I would know in my life and realized that coding can be pretty fun as well.</p>
					<p style="font-size:1.3vw;">I still have a passion for marketing and I consider that to be my main expertise, but with the background of a web developer, I feel that I can do so much more than before, especialy living out here where everyone seems to need someone that can code something. Other things I'm keen on include: eating, playing video games, working out, and baseball (go Giants!).</p>
					<p style="font-size:1.3vw; font-style:italic; font-weight:100;">Programming specialities include: Javascript, Node.js, AngularJS, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails (in progress)</p>
